### **How to Practice:**
1. Solve problems from coding platforms like [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/), [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/), or [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/).
2. Focus on understanding the **time complexity** and **space complexity** of your solutions.
3. Try to solve problems without looking at hints or solutions. Use hints only after making an honest effort.
4. Revisit problems you struggled with after a few days to reinforce your learning.
